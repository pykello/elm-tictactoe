# Tic-tac-toe in Elm

This is [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) written in [Elm language](http://elm-lang.org/). I wrote it as my first attempt to learn Elm.

You can see it in action at [http://pykello.github.io/elm-tictactoe/](http://pykello.github.io/elm-tictactoe/).

# Building

Run the following command to generate a HTML file which implements tic-tac-toe:

```
elm make tictactoe.elm --output=tictactoe.html
```

You can open ```tictactoe.html``` in your browser and see the output.
